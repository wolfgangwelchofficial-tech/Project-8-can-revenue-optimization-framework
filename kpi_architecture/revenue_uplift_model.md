# Location-Level Revenue Uplift Model

## Baseline Methodology

Each location was benchmarked against its highest historical revenue year.

Revenue was segmented by stream:

- Bar Sales
- Event Revenue
- Promotional Activations
- Partnership-Supported Revenue

This avoided uniform targets and respected location-specific performance ceilings.

---

## Uplift Targeting Logic

Target established:

+15% over historical peak per revenue stream.

Example:

If highest weekly revenue was $50,000:
Target became $57,500 weekly benchmark.

---

## Monitoring Framework

Weekly:
- Variance to target
- Revenue pacing trends
- Labor-to-sales ratio impact

Monthly:
- Revenue stream contribution analysis
- Promotional ROI validation

Quarterly:
- Standard recalibration if exceeded
- Structural performance review

---

## Strategic Intent

The model shifted performance management from maintenance to expansion.

Each location competed against its own ceiling.
