# KPI-Triggered Labor Realignment Logic

## Philosophy

Labor alignment was treated as a performance control variable, not a static schedule.

Adjustments were made when KPIs or sales pacing indicated misalignment.

---

## Trigger Conditions

Labor realignment was initiated when:

- Weekly sales performance fell below expected pacing
- KPI targets (weekly or stream-level) were not being met
- Specific dayparts underperformed consistently
- Events required staffing compression or expansion
- Operational capacity and demand were out of alignment

---

## Adjustment Levers

Common realignment actions included:

- Rebalancing staffing by daypart (peak vs non-peak)
- Adjusting role coverage (floor vs bar vs support)
- Scaling event staffing to expected attendance and revenue objectives
- Reducing coverage during low-density hours
- Increasing coverage during revenue-dense periods to protect throughput

## Cadence & Feedback Loop

- Weekly: labor adjustments based on sales pacing and KPI variance
- Monthly: evaluation of recurring underperformance patterns
- Quarterly: structural recalibration if patterns persisted

Labor decisions were tied to revenue density, not habit.
