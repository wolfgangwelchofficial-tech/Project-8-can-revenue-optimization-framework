# Commercial Performance Optimization  
BSC Management | Senior Operations Manager

---

## Executive Overview

Following cross-functional stabilization, the next phase of operational maturity focused on performance uplift and commercial optimization.

Each location was benchmarked against its highest-performing historical year.

The objective:

Achieve a minimum 15% uplift across all primary revenue streams through structured KPI targeting, vendor leverage, and partnership-driven activation.

This was not cost-cutting.

It was revenue engineering.

## 1. Location-Level KPI Architecture

Optimization began with historical performance analysis.

Each location was evaluated independently using:

- Highest revenue year baseline
- Revenue segmented by stream (bar, events, promotions, partnerships)
- Seasonal performance patterns
- High-output campaign benchmarking

Targets were set at:

+15% over previous peak performance per location.

This avoided unrealistic uniform company-wide targets and respected location-specific dynamics.

## 2. Strategic Vendor & Liquor Partnership Leverage

Revenue expansion was supported by strengthening liquor partnerships across locations.

This included:

- Coordinated multi-location vendor negotiations
- Leveraging total volume across sites
- Securing promotional funding support
- Event sponsorship activation
- Brand-backed marketing partnerships

Partnerships were treated as commercial accelerators, not transactional supply relationships.

## 3. Performance-Based Labor Realignment

Labor adjustments were not constant.

They were KPI-triggered.

When sales performance or revenue pacing fell below targets:

- Scheduling realignment occurred
- Labor-to-sales ratio recalibrated
- Event staffing scaled to demand
- Underperforming time blocks optimized

Labor became responsive to performance rather than static.

## 4. Event Funding & Commercial Activation

Budget expansion was not driven by internal cuts.

It was driven by external leverage.

Funding strategies included:

- Vendor-backed promotional funding
- Liquor-sponsored activations
- Partnership-aligned event budgets
- Revenue-sharing agreements

This reduced capital strain while increasing top-line opportunity.

## Performance Governance Cadence

Revenue optimization operated on a layered review cadence:

### Weekly – Tactical Monitoring
- Sales pacing review by location
- Revenue stream variance tracking
- Immediate labor alignment if KPIs slipped
- Identification of short-term promotional opportunities

### Monthly – Trend Validation
- Performance trend analysis by revenue stream
- Partnership activation effectiveness review
- Location-specific strategy adjustment
- Identification of structural underperformance

### Quarterly – Strategic Calibration
- Historical benchmark comparison
- 15% uplift progress validation
- Standard elevation when performance exceeded targets
- Reallocation of partnership leverage where needed

Standards were not static.

If a location achieved its uplift target ahead of schedule, the performance baseline was raised.

Optimization was iterative and adaptive.
