# Partnership Negotiation Framework (Liquor & Vendor Leverage)

## Purpose

Partnerships were treated as commercial growth levers—not transactional supply relationships.

The objective was to secure:

- Promotional funding support
- Event sponsorship activation
- Brand-backed marketing amplification
- Preferential pricing and value-add inventory structures where possible

---

## Negotiation Inputs

Partnership asks were supported by:

- Location-level performance benchmarks
- Weekly sales pacing
- Event calendar and activation plans
- Brand placement opportunities (menus, specials, featured cocktails)
- Multi-location activation potential (where applicable)

---

## Deal Structures Used

Common partnership constructs included:

- **Sponsored Event Support**
  - Vendor-funded budget allocation for promotions or activations
- **Brand Placement Agreements**
  - Featured menu placement and campaign integration
- **Co-Marketing Commitments**
  - Vendor-provided content, assets, or amplification support
- **Promotional Inventory Support**
  - Discounts, buy-backs, or strategic product support for activations

---

## Activation Requirements

No partnership was considered “complete” until it was operationalized into:

- Defined promotional calendar slots
- Marketing deliverables
- Ops readiness requirements (specials, training, service flow)
- Finance tracking for funding utilization and ROI

---

## Governance

Partnerships were reviewed through a layered cadence:

- Weekly: activation pacing and sales response
- Monthly: partnership effectiveness and ROI validation
- Quarterly: renegotiation opportunities and standard elevation

Partnership value was measured by outcomes, not signed agreements.
