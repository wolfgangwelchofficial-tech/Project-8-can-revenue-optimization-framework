# Event Funding Leverage Model (Vendor-Backed Activation)

## Purpose

Internal budgets were expanded through external leverage.

Rather than cutting internally to fund events, commercial partners and vendors were used to activate additional capital where possible.

---

## Funding Mechanisms

Funding was activated through:

- Liquor brand sponsorship support
- Vendor-backed promotional budgets
- Co-marketing agreements tied to activation calendars
- Partnership-supported specials and featured product placement
- Event-based funding requests tied to measurable revenue goals

---

## Activation Workflow

1. Event concept identified at location level
2. Funding needs defined (marketing, props/decor, specials, staffing)
3. Vendor/partner alignment pursued for support
4. Sponsorship or funding terms confirmed
5. Activation requirements assigned across departments
6. Performance tracked against defined objectives

---

## Cross-Department Activation

Every funded activation required coordination across:

- Operations (staffing + execution readiness)
- Marketing (promotion calendar + deliverables)
- Vendor Management (partner terms + deliverables)
- Finance (budget tracking + reconciliation)
- IT (POS specials, campaign tags, reporting)

---

## Governance

Funding performance was reviewed through:

- Weekly pacing (revenue response)
- Monthly ROI validation (activation effectiveness)
- Quarterly standard elevation (raise targets if activation exceeds baseline)

Funding was treated as a repeatable commercial system, not a one-off win.
